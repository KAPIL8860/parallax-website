            A parallax website is a modern web design technique where background images move at a slower rate than
            foreground images as users scroll down the page, creating a sense of depth and immersion. These websites
            often employ layered designs and scrolling effects to engage users visually. Typically featuring captivating
            graphics, animations, and storytelling elements, parallax websites guide users through a narrative or
            showcase products in an interactive manner. They are designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to
            various screen sizes and devices. However, designers must balance aesthetics with usability and performance,
            optimizing images and animations for smooth loading times. While visually stunning, parallax websites
            require careful attention to ensure a seamless user experience across platforms.

               1.Scrolling Effects: Parallax websites use scrolling effects to create the illusion of depth. As users scroll
            down the page, background images move at a slower rate than foreground images, creating a sense of motion
            and immersion.

            2.Layered Design: Parallax websites often use a layered design approach, with multiple layers of images or
            content that move independently as users scroll. This layering effect adds depth and dimension to the
            design.

            3.Engaging Visuals: Parallax websites often feature visually stunning graphics, animations, and multimedia
            elements to capture users' attention and create a memorable browsing experience.

             4.Storytelling: Parallax scrolling can be used to guide users through a narrative or tell a story, with each
            scroll revealing new content or progressing the storyline.

            5.Responsive Design: Modern parallax websites are designed to be responsive, meaning they adapt to different
            screen sizes and devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</pre>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>One of the first implementations of parallax scrolling in the browser was created and shared in a blog post
            by web developer Glutnix in 2007, this included example code and a demo using JavaScript and CSS 2 that
            supported Internet Explorer 6 and other browsers of that era.[18][19] However, it wasn't until 2011 and the
            introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3 coding that the technique became popular with Web designers. Advocates argue
            it is a simple way to embrace the fluidity of the Web.

            Proponents use parallax backgrounds as a tool to better engage users and improve the overall experience that
            a website provides. However, a Purdue University study, published in 2013, revealed the following findings:
            "... although parallax scrolling enhanced certain aspects of the user experience, it did not necessarily
            improve the overall user experience". A undated study occurring during or after 2010 by Dede Frederick,
            James Mohler, Mihaela Vorvoreanu, and Ronald Glotzbach noted that parallax scrolling "may cause certain
            people to experience nausea."[</p>
